            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p><strong>Belift Lab</strong>, a collaborative venture between CJ ENM and HYBE Corporation, 
                is making waves in the K-pop industry. By fusing Western music sensibilities 
                with the rich traditions of Korean pop, Belift Lab aims to cultivate artists 
                who can resonate with a global audience. With groups like ENHYPEN and ILLIT under 
                their wing, the agency has already showcased its ability to produce talented and 
                versatile acts. HYBE's recent acquisition of Belift Lab further solidifies the 
                agency's position as a major player in the global music scene, promising exciting 
                new projects and opportunities for its artists.</p>

            <h3>ENHYPEN</h3>
            <p><strong>ENHYPEN</strong> is the first boyband created by BELIFT LAB, consisting of seven multinational members JUNGWON, 
                HEESEUNG, JAY, JAKE, SUNGHOON, SUNOO and NI-KI. They are the finalists of global music competition show 
                I-LAND, which finished airing in September 2020. The members have already shown infinite possibilities and 
                growth not only as individuals, but also as a team. Similar to the hyphen(-) that connects one word to another, 
                ENHYPEN means that seven different boys connect to discover one another and grow together. It also indicates 
                their ambitious plan to connect people and the world through their music.</p>

            <h3>ILLIT</h3>
            <p><strong>ILLIT</strong> (아일릿; also stylized as :ll:+) is a five-member 
                multinational girl group under Belift Lab. Formed through 
                the JTBC reality show R U Next? and originally as six, 
                they made their debut on March 25, 2024 with the mini 
                album Super Real Me. Their group name is derived 
                from the phrase "I Will Be It". It is a 
                group name that combines the autonomous and proactive 
                will (I will) with the pronoun (It) that signifies 
                something special. Depending on the verb that fits 
                between the two words, it can become anything.</p>
